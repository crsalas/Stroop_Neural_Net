# Stroop_Neural_Net

The current neural network model aimed to simulate the following aspects of the human cognitive system:
* the effect of differential practice
* attention allocation
* response conflict resolution, and 
* differences in responses as a function of stimulus set. 

The model was able to generate evidence of each of these and demonstrates how they change across the processing time-course.
