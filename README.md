# Stroop_Neural_Net

This neural network model aims to simulate the following aspects of the human cognitive system:
* the effect of differential practice
* attention allocation
* response conflict resolution, and 
* differences in responses as a function of stimulus set. 

Initial runs of this model provides evidence for each of these, and demonstrates how they change across the processing time-course of an adapted version of the Stroop task.
